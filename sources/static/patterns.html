<h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="introduction"></a>1 - Introduction</h2>
This document describes the common patterns and design criteria that are followed in the APIs defined by Webinos. Webinos APIs are specified through WebIDL together with text descriptions that define the behaviour of the API interfaces, methods and attributes.

Apart from the Webinos defined APIs, Webinos is going to refer to other APIs defined by other parties (e.g. W3C, WAC...). Webinos is not going to modify those APIs, so it is anticipated that some of them may not be aligned with the patterns defined in this document.

In most of the cases, this document does not prescribe a unique solution for the different API characteristics, but describes what are the feasible alternatives, what are the preferred one(s) and the situations in which different alternatives should be used.
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="webidlusage"></a>2 - WebIDL Usage</h2>
<p>
Webinos Device APIs are defined through WebIDL. In particular, the version of WebIDL specification used in Webinos is the W3C 1st June 2011 Editor's Draft . W3C WebIDL specification defines interface definition language, Web IDL. Web IDL is an IDL variant with a number of features that allow the behavior of ECMAScript objects to be specified more readily. The specification details how interfaces described with Web IDL correspond to constructs within ECMAScript.
</p>
<p>
The JavaScript APIs available to developers, will be the ECMAScript binding of the WebIDL code detailed in Webinos APIs specification. Additionally to the WebIDL definitions, the Webinos APIs provide additional information that further describe in prose the functionality of the methods formally defined in WebIDL (e.g. what are the potential error cases, what are the valid arguments expected by the implementation...).
</p>
</div>


<div class="section" lang="en">
<h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="asynchronousmethods"></a>3 - Asynchronous Methods </h2>
<p>
ECMAScript methods can be either synchronous or asynchronous. Methods using the synchronous mode of operation do not return control to the caller until the operation is complete. Asynchronous methods return immediately and notify the caller at some point in the future of the results via callback method(s). The callback(s) are specified as input parameters to the asynchronous method. Methods that may take a long time to be executed or that may be subject to security prompt should be defined as asynchronous methods in Webinos APIs.
</p>
<p>
There are different approaches to define asynchronous methods:
<ul>
<li> Passing arguments that are functions that handle the callbacks.</li>
<li> Passing a full interface as input argument.</li>
<li> Using events instead of methods to perform asynchronous operations.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<div class="section" lang="en">
<h3 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="functiononly"></a>3.1 - Function Only Success Callbacks</h3>
<p>
This is used by many specifications (e.g. WAC APIs, W3C Geolocation...). In this case, the first two input arguments for the asynchronous methods are:
<ul>
<li>The first argument is a Function object that specifies the callback to be invoked in case of success (e.g. SuccessCallback).</li>
<li>The second argument is a Function object instantiating the ErrorCallback interface.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Only one of the callbacks is invoked and it is invoked only once.
</p>
<p>
The following WebIDL excerpt specifies how this approach can be specified.
</p>
<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Function Only Success Callback WebIDL</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
PendingOperation fooOperation(in SuccessCallback successCallback, 
                              in ErrorCallback? errorCallback, 
                              in Options options);

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject] interface SuccessCallback {
   void onsuccess();
};

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject] interface ErrorCallback {
   void onerror(in Error error);
};
</div>

<p>Which could be used by developers as follows:</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Function Only Success Callback Usage</b></span>
<pre class="examplecode prettyprint">
fooOperation(handleSuccess(){alert("Operation Completed Successfully");},
             handleError(e){alert("Operation Failed: " + e.message );},
             {option1:0, option1:1000});
</pre>

<p> This is the <b>preferred way to specify asynchronous operations in Webinos APIs</b> as it is a well-known and simple mechanism.</p>
<p> It is recommended that Webinos APIs specify that the second input argument (the errorCallback) is always optional and nullable, so that when it is not included or it is null or undefined, the implementation is just silent about any error that occurs during the asynchronous phase of the operation. NOTE: In some cases the "optional" tag could not be prefixed in the WebIDL definition because otherwise all the subsequents attributes should have been also optional which may not be possible in all the cases. However, in those cases the optionality of the errorCallback could be documented in the method description and by declaring the argument as nullable by suffixing the '?' character to the argument data type.</p>
<p>
It is also recommended for Webinos APIs that the first input parameter be mandatory; if it does not contain a valid value (e.g. it is null or undefined or does not contain a function), this will raises a <code>TypeError</code> exception (as defined in the Web IDL specification).
</p>

<p>For example, the following WebIDL definition states that the errorCallback and options arguments are optional and nullable:</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Function Only Success Callback - Optional ErrorCallback</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
void fooOperation(in SuccessCallback successCallback, 
                              in optional ErrorCallback? errorCallback, 
                              in optional Options? options);

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject] interface SuccessCallback {
   void onsuccess();
};

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject] interface ErrorCallback {
   void onerror(in Error error);
};
</div>

<p>And could be used by developer as follows:</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Function Only Success Callback - Optional error callback usage</b></span>
<pre class="examplecode prettyprint">
// The following calls are equivalent

fooOperation(handleSuccess(){alert("Operation Completed Successfully");},
             null, 
             null);

fooOperation(handleSuccess(){alert("Operation Completed Successfully");});

fooOperation(handleSuccess(){alert("Operation Completed Successfully");},
             null);
</pre>


<p>If the trailing arguments are not optional, the optional keyword cannot be included in the WebIDL definition and the possibility of having a null errorCallback should be described in the prose:</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Function Only Success Callback - Optional ErrorCallback</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
/**
 * \brief Performs foo operation asynchronously.
 *
 * If any error occurs while attempting to add the event item, the errorCallback 
 * function that was passed in the invocation MUST be called.
 *
 * In any of the above cases where the errorCallback should be invoked, 
 * if the developer has not passed a valid ErrorCallback
 * (e.g. it is null or undefined), no action is required and the developer 
 * is not notified of the error.
 *
 * \param successCallback function called when the invocation ends successfully.
 * \param errorCallback function called when an error occurs.
 * \param options The options for the foo operation.
 */
void fooOperation(in SuccessCallback successCallback, 
                              in ErrorCallback? errorCallback, 
                              in DOMString selector);

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject] interface SuccessCallback {
   void onsuccess();
};

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject] interface ErrorCallback {
   void onerror(in Error error);
};
</div>

<p>And could be used by developer as follows:</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Function Only Success Callback - Optional error callback usage</b></span>
<pre class="examplecode prettyprint">
// The following calls are equivalent

fooOperation(handleSuccess(){alert("Operation Completed Successfully");},
             null, 
             "argument");

fooOperation(handleSuccess(){alert("Operation Completed Successfully");},
             undefined, 
             "argument");
</pre>


<p>An alternative to having two callbacks could consist in having a single callback and pass a parameter that indicates success or failure as in the following example:</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Function Only Success Callback - One function for both error and success</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
void fooOperation(in Callback callback, 
                              in Options options);

[Callback=FunctionOnly, NoInterfaceObject] interface Callback {
   void onsuccess(Response response);
};

</div>

<p>Such an API could be used as follows:</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Function Only Success Callback - One function for both error and success usage</b></span>
<pre class="examplecode prettyprint">
fooOperation(handleResult(response){
                if (response.result === 0)
                  alert("Operation Completed Successfully");
                else
                  alert("Operation Failed");
             },
             {option1:0, option2:1000});
</pre>

<p>
This approach is discouraged in favour of having two different callback function as it:
<ul>
<li>
Allows a simpler successCallback function because it doesn't have to analyze the return code.
</li>
<li>
Emphasizes to the developer that he should implement error handling (e.g., the possibility that permission will be denied) by having a specific function for the error situation.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

</p>
</div> <!-- end section 3.1-->
<div class="section" lang="en">
<h3 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="interfacecallbacks"></a>3.2 - Interface Callbacks</h3>
<p>
In this approach, instead of using funtion(s) as input argument(s) for handling the callback an interface is passed. That interface is responsible for implementing the right methods that will handle the adequate callbacks. This approach will be used by Webinos APIs when not only the success and error events are needed, or when multiple results are expected from an operation. For instance, in WAC, this approach has been followed in order to receive success/error notifications for every recipient a SMS is sent to.
</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Interface Callback Example</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
void foo(in InterfaceCallback callback, in Options options);

[Callback, NoInterfaceObject] interface MessageSendCallback {
   void onsuccess();
   void onerror(Error e);
   void onotherevent(DOMString event);
   void onindividualsuccess(in DOMString code);
   void onindividualerror(in Error e, in DOMString code);
};
</div>

<p> The first parameter of the asynchronous method is now an interface that specifies the different methods to be invoked for every notification and in case of final success.</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Function Only Success Callback - One function for both error and success usage</b></span>
<pre class="examplecode prettyprint">
 // Define the interface callback
 var callback = {
       onsuccess: function() {
         alert("The full operation completed succesfully");},
       onindividualsuccess: function(code) {
         alert("The partial operation " + code " completed");},
       onindividualsuccess: function(e, code) {
         alert("The partial operation " + code " failed " + e.message);},
       onerror: function(e) {
         alert("At least one error ocurred " + e.message);}
 };
 
 // Send request
 foo(callback, {option1:0, option1:1000});
</pre>
 
<p>The advantage of this approach is that it is very flexible and extensible. However there are some drawbacks such as: </p>
<ul>
<li> It is more complex than the use of functions. It is not the typical JavaScript approach. </li>
<li> Checking the validity of the Interface may be complicated and difficult to be specified. E.g. What happens if the onsuccess method is not defined in the callback Interface?</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<h3 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="returnvalues"></a>3.3 - Asynchronous Methods Return Values</h3>
<p>
Asynchronous methods do not return the result of the operation directly but in the successCallback. When the method is executed it immediately returns with no result. WAC (and some W3C specs) have made asynchronous call to return a PendingOperation object, which may be used for emulating a syncrhonous call (by invoking a wait method) and for cancelling the asynchronous operation (by invoking a cancel method).
</p>
<p>
However, using a generic pending operation could have consistency issues as cancelling an operation may not be always possible and the expected behaviour of cancel operation may differ across different APIs.
</p>
<p> Webinos APIs will not use a generic pending operation interface. If any Webinos API needs to use such a feature, it will be defined by the API in order to provide a meaningful API specific meaning for the cancel operation.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<h3 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="returnvalues"></a>3.4 - Using DOM Events instead of Asychronous Methods </h3>

<p>DOM events are an alternative for performing asynchronous operations instead of using callbacks. In some situations, where an object is also part of the DOM tree, DOM events could be used for asynchronous notifications. This approach allows developers to register event handlers as observers of the DOM tree.</p>
<p>This approach has been used by different W3C specifications such as the DeviceOrientation and the DAP BatteryStatus event.
</div>


<div class="section" lang="en">
<h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="errorhandling"></a>4 - Error Handling</h2>
<p>
Multiple JavaScript APIs use different schemas for identifying errors, the key differences amongst them being:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The class of the error objects: Standard ECMAScript Error, a class inheriting from Error, a new class for all the APIs, one class for API...
</li>
<li>The error codes: Centralized/Decentralized Error codes, Brand new ones, DOM Level 3 codes...
</ul>

Webinos APIs do not have a unique Error Object used by all the APIs. Different APIs create their own dedicated Error Objects. The API is also responsible for specifying the error codes that are required. Due to that, it is anticipated that the same error situation could lead to different error codes depending on the API used. 
<p>Webinos APIs do not have a unique Error interface used by all the APIs. Every API defines their own specialized Error class which includes their own specific error codes. This is approach that has been followed by W3C Geolocation and DAP. The error interface could be a brand new one or an interface extending the standard ECMAScript Error interface.</p>
<p>
As every API is the responsible for specifying its required error codes and no centralized error code repository is going to be used, it is anticipated that the same error situation could lead to different error codes depending on the API used. However, the webinos APIs will try to reuse the Error codes defined in DOM Level 3 specification are re-used whenever possible and extend if required regardless of the approach chosen from the ones described above </p>

<p> For instance, an API could use the following WebIDL definition for its Error interface </p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>API Specific FooAPIError</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
 [NoInterfaceObject] interface FooAPIError {
    
    readonly attribute unsigned short code;
    
    readonly attribute DOMString message;
    
    const unsigned short      UNKNOWN_ERR                    = 0;
    const unsigned short      NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR              = 9;
    const unsigned short      TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR              = 17;
    const unsigned short      SECURITY_ERR                   = 18;
    const unsigned short      NETWORK_ERR                    = 19;
  };
</pre>
</div>
</div>


<p>The design choice for notifying about error situations to developers is different depending on the kind of method being launched (for simplicity FooAPIError object has been used in the examples).</p>


<div class="section" lang="en">
<h3 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name=""></a>4.1 - Synchronous methods </h3>
<p>
When a synchronous method is executed all error conditions should be indicated by throwing an instance of the Error object (FooAPIException in the example) synchronously. These error conditions can be documented in WebIDL through the raises (FooAPIException) clause. The various error codes that may be returned in the exception (FooAPIException) instance are documented through the \throw doxygen tag in the widl documentation.</p>
<p> Interfaces to be thrown by methods should be declared in WebIDL through the <code>exception</code> keyword.</p>

<p>For instance, the following idl excerpt declares a synchronous function and the FooAPIException object as an exception.</p>
<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Error Handling in Synchronous Method</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
/*
 * \brief The FooAPIException
 */
exception FooAPIException{

  unsigned short code;

  DOMString message;

  const unsigned short FOO1_ERR = 0;
  const unsigned short FOO2_ERR = 1;
}


/*
 * \brief the syncrhonous foo method
 * \param fooShort The operation code.
 *
 * \throw FooAPIException with error code FOO2_ERR if foo2 occurs. 
 * \throw FooAPIException with error code FOO1_ERR if foo1 occurs. 
 */
void foo(in short fooShort)
                      raises(FooAPIException);
</div>
<p>The throw clause are converted by the webinos documentation toolchain into HTML code, for instance:</p>
<div>
<i><code>
<h5>Exceptions</h5>
<ul>
          <li class="exception">FooAPIException:
        <div class="description"><p>
 with error code FOO1_ERR if foo1 occurs. 
                </p></div>
<div class="description"><p>
 with error code FOO2_ERR if foo2 occurs. 
                </p></div>
</li>
</ul>
</code></i>
</div>

<div class="section" lang="en">
<h3 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name=""></a>4.2 - Asynchronous methods </h3>
<p>When an asynchronous method is executed, all the errors should be returned in the errorCallback or in the interface that was passed as input argument (see section 3 for more details).</p>

<p>However, before starting the asynchronous phase of the operation, methods cannot return errors in the ErrorCallback. This is usually the case for the situations in which the arguments provided are not of the expected type. In those situations, exceptions will be raised as defined in the Web IDL specification.</p>

<p>Any other error will be returned in the ErrorCallback that was passed as input argument to the asynchronous function as a FooAPIError, the documentation of the method will specify which codes and under which conditions the error will be returned in the ErrorCallback. If no error callback is passed or it is null or undefined, no additional notification is needed (i.e. the method fails silently).</p>

<p>Type conversions between the supplied arguments and the declared IDL argument type are performed in accordance with the ECMAScript WebIDL binding.</p>

<p>The following is a WebIDL excerpt declaring an asynchronous method</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Error Handling in Asynchronous Methods</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">

/*
 * \brief The FooAPIError
 */
interface FooAPIError{

  readonly attribute unsigned short code;

  readonly attribute DOMString message;

  const unsigned short FOO1_ERR = 0;
  const unsigned short FOO2_ERR = 1;
}

/*
 * \brief Error callback definition
 */
[Callback, NoInterfaceObject]
interface ErrorCallback {
  void onerror(in FooAPIError code);
};


/*
 * \brief the synchronous foo method
 * \param fooShort The operation code.
 *
 */
void foo(in SuccessCallback successCallback, 
         in ErrorCallback? errorCallback, 
         in Options options)
         raises(FooAPIException);
</div>

<p>
The errors returned in the errorCallback are specified in the method description as in the following WebIDL.
</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Error Handling in Asynchronous Methods</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
/*

 * &lt;li&gt;
 *  FOO2: If foo2 error occurs. 
 * &lt;li&gt;

 *
 */
void foo(in SuccessCallback successCallback, 
         in ErrorCallback? errorCallback, 
         in Options options);
</div>
<p> That will generate the following documentation through the toolchain: </p>
<p><i><code>

the successCallback. Otherwise, the errorCallback will be invoked with an FooAPIError with an appropriate
error code amongst the following:

              <li>

<h2 class="title" style="clear: both;"><a name="optionalnullable"></a>5 - Optional, Nullable and Valid Arguments</h2>

<p>Web IDL provides a mechanism to document that an argument is optional. In order to so, the keyword optional must be included just before the argument type. All the optional arguments that are used in Webinos APIs are marked with that keyword.</p>

<p>E.g. the following WebIDL excerpt specifies that the second and third input arguments is optional.</p>
<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Optional Arguments</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
    void foo(in SuccessCallback successCallback, 
             in optional ErrorCallback errorCallback,
             in optional Options options)
         raises (FooAPIException); 
</div>
<p>Optional arguments must be always in the last position of the argument list. E.g. There cannot be a non-optional after an optional argument. Optional arguments may be omitted by the Developers. For instance, both calls of the method foo are valid:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre name="code" class="examplecode prettyprint"> 
  foo(function(){alert("Operation completed")});
  foo(function(){alert("Operation completed")}, 
                                  errorHandler(e){"Error occured";});
  foo(function(){alert("Operation completed")}, 
                                  errorHandler(e){"Error occured";}, 
                                  {fooparam1:10000});

<p>If an optional argument has not the appropriate type or cannot be coerced to it, implementations will throw a TYPE_ERROR exception as defined in Web IDL.</p>

<p>A nullable input argument is identified by the '?' character that is suffixed to the Data Type. This character can be used for Primitive EcmaScript Data Types and for derived ones. As undefined is coerced to null, the same behaviour with regards to null and undefined are expected for any input argument of an interface (derived) type declared as nullable.</p>

<p>For primitive types, consider the following WebIDL declaration:</p>
<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Optional and Nullable primitive type arguments</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
void foo(in DOMString mandatoryArgument, 
         [TreatUndefinedAs=Null] in optional DOMString? optionalArgument)
</div>
<p>The following calls are valid and equivalent (the last argument can be ommitted (is optional) and can be null (is nullable)).</p>

<div class="example">
<pre name="code" class="examplecode prettyprint"> 
foo("mandated", null);
foo("mandated");
</div>

<p>For interface types, consider the following WebIDL declaration:</p>

<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Optional and Nullable interface type arguments</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">

void foo(in SuccessCallback successCallback, 
         in optional ErrorCallback? errorCallback,
         in optional Options? options)
         raises (FooAPIException);
</div>
<p>The following invocations are all valid and equivalent:</p>

<div class="example">
<pre name="code" class="examplecode prettyprint"> 
  foo(f(){alert("Success")});
  foo(f(){alert("Success")}, null);
  foo(f(){alert("Success")}, null, null);
</div>

<p>Obviously, in all the cases above no options are passed to the function and in case of any error no notification is sent back to the developer.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that coercion is used to check if an input argument is of the valid type. ECMAScript is a loosely typed language, and hence some assumptions that may be true for other programming languages are not valid in ECMAScript. Additionally the rules specified by WebIDL spec around Types must also be taken into account.</p>

<p>For instance, for the following WebIDL declaration:</p>
<div id="container"><div><span class="signatureBlockTitle"><b>Coercion</b></span><pre class="webidl prettyprint">
    void foo(in long watchId)
             raises (FooAPIException);
</div>
<p>The call <code>foo("Notalong");</code> will not throw a TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR as "Foo" can be coerced to NaN (Not an number) wich is a valid instance of long primitive type.</p>
</div>
